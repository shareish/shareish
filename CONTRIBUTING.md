# How to contribute to Shareish

Thank you for wanting to contribute to the Shareish project ! :green_heart:

## Do you want to translate Shareish into another language (or improve the existing translation) ?
1. Get the latest version of the [translation csv file](https://github.com/shareish/shareish/blob/main/frontend/src/locales/translations.csv).
2. If the language is not yet present, add a column, otherwise fill the existing column.
3. [Contact us](on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/shareish/shareish/discussions) or info@shareish.org if you are more comfortable) when done or open a pull request (see below similar procedure than submitting a patch that fixes a bug).

## Did you find a bug?
1. Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/shareish/shareish/issues).
2. If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/shareish/shareish/issues/new). Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, e.g. a description, a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?
1. Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
2. Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
3. Before submitting a patch related to the front-end, please check if you follow [VueJS style guide](https://v2.vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/?redirect=true).

## Do you intend to add a new feature?
If you don't have a specific idea but you want to contribute to the code, please have a look at the "good first issue" label under [Issues](https://github.com/shareish/shareish/issues).
If you have a specific new feature in mind, please ensure it is not already under development in a branch or assigned to someone under [Issues](https://github.com/shareish/shareish/issues). If you don't find a similar planned feature, please contact us using [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/shareish/shareish/discussions) or submit an issue describing the enhancement you plan to implement.
