  "shareish_description2": "where specific items (goods and services to give or to lend, requests for help, free events) can be viewed, added, and edited by registered users. Items can be geolocated so it is very easy to explore your neighbourdhood hence foster local mutual aid, at your street corner or in your area. Users can start conversations to get further details about an item/request or to arrange an appointment for the exchange. This items can also be viewed as a list where they are sorted by date. External public data (such as free drinking water sources, public bookcases and gift boxes, falling fruits, ...) can also be displayed. Search mechanisms and AI methods can be used to ease search and encoding",
  "faq": "Frequently asked questions (FAQ)",
  "faq_nothing": "I have nothing to give/lend, can I still use Shareish ?",
  "faq_nothing_answer": "The short answer is: YES ! The long answer is: YES, first take some time and have a look at requests, maybe you can help someone right away ! If not, please note by receiving a free good or service from others, you potentially release them from their feeling of indebtedness as they were probably previously in the same situation than you are. Also consider that you might have items/skills in the future to give/lend, it is not an issue not to have right now, Shareish is promoting mutual aid, solidarity and indirect exchange over the long term. Anyway, please have a look at your belongings/skills, you might already have things/skills to share but you are not yet aware it might be useful for others (see next question) so feel free to reference them on the Shareish platform as others might be interested in the future. Also, if you are aware of free events (give-away, repair café, ...), feel free to encode them",
  "faq_examples": "Can you give examples of items we can create and find on Shareish ?",
  "faq_examples_answer": "Items can be offers (of goods or services), requests (of goods or services), loans (of goods), or free events, so the possibilities are many. Services include, for example, helping someone to move furniture, picking up or delivering groceries, driving them to a certain place, advising them when filling out an administrative document, walking their dog, help to clean up after a flood, ... In terms of goods, we can imagine lending or donating books, kitchen utensils, surplus vegetables from the garden, household appliances, games for kids, a blanket, clothes, protective masks , ... Events can be, for example, repair workshops by volunteers (Repair café), free solidarity meals, ... The possibilities for mutual aid are endless!",
  "faq_everything": "Can I share/search everything ?",
  "faq_everything_answer": "Yes, except items/services/events that are prohibited or regulated by law, false, misleading, harmful, or obscene. The Shareish developers and administrators (referred hereafter as The Shareish team) are not liable for any Shareish web server content. The Shareish developers do not control, and are not responsible for content made available through any Shareish web server. Under no circumstances will the Shareish team be liable in any way for any content or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any content made available via any Shareish web server. You acknowledge that not all content is pre-screened or approved by the Shareish team, but that Shareish web server moderators/administrators shall have the right (but not the obligation) in its sole discretion to refuse, delete or move any content that is available via their Shareish web server, for violating the terms of use or for any other reason.",
  "faq_address": "Are item adresses correct on Shareish ? If I'm interested by an item, can I go there and get it ?",
  "faq_address_answer": "The users who encode the elements themselves decide on the precision of the address they encode. Some users will reference the exact address, others a street name, district, city. In any case, it is recommended to start a conversation with a user of an item to find out the exact address and decide how to proceed with the sharing. For public elements (bookcases, give boxes, drinking water sources, etc.), the addresses are in principle verified by the OpenStreetMap and Falling Fruit communities but it is recommended to further inquire by clicking on the external link (for example some donation boxes are located in buildings that are not open 24 hours a day).",
  "faq_colors": "What is the meaning of the colors of the items on the map?",
  "faq_colors_answer": "The colored markers allow you to identify elements added by Shareish users. The red position markers are requests, the green dots are offers (donation, proposals), the yellow dots are loan proposals, the purple dots are events, the blue dot indicates your detected position. In addition to these elements, you can display public data such as book and donation boxes, drinking water sources,... These public points are symbolized by icons (a book for a book box, a cabinet for a donation box, ...).",
  "faq_device": "Can I use Shareish on my computer, tablet or mobile phone?",
  "faq_device_answer": "Yes, Shareish is a website that can be viewed on these different devices. However, we have not tested all combinations of equipment, navigation software, operating systems, if you notice any bugs or display inconveniences, please contact us (see below)",
  "faq_data_collection": " What information does Shareish collect about me and for what purpose ?",
  "faq_data_collection_answer": "To become a member of a Shareish web server and access information, we collect (store in a computer database) personally identifiable information that you voluntarily provide through the Shareish website (Sign Up form). We do require a basic level of data (an email address, a username, a password) so that you may then log in and receive notifications via email (when getting new messages or when new items are created). Optionnaly, you can also provide additional information (such as other social networks profile) and your geographic location so that the Shareish web server can display items in your geographic area. Shareish platform keep all functional data in a database as long as you have an active account. Shareish platform do not sell such information to third parties. Shareish web server does not utilize cookies (only session data are stored in your browser). Shareish uses the HTTPS protocol so that all communications between your browser and the Shareish web server are encrypted. If you have any questions about the use of your personal information, please contact us (see below).",
  "faq_public_resources": "I want to edit or add public resources (public bookcases, drinking water sources,...), how can I do it ?",
  "faq_public_resources_answer": "On Shareish you can display specific resources created by users (called individual items) and other public resources (such as drinking water sources). Your specific items are stored in an internal Shareish database and editable on Shareish, but public resources are retrieved from the open-access OpenStreetMap database. To edit public resources, when you click on the map on it, we provide a link (retrieved from OSM) to the corresponding OpenStreetMap node page where it is possible to edit it. An alternative is to use other existing editor tools, those editors allow you to edit and add POI (point of interest) that are later available to the whole OpenStreetMap community and therefore later on Shareish:",
  "faq_how_to_contribute": "How can I contribute to Shareish development ?",
  "faq_how_to_contribute_answer": "You can send us constructive comments/issues, remarks, ... (see last question). If you are a software developer, you will soon (after peer review) be able to contribute to the source code (solve current issues or implement new features). If you want to translate the website into your own language, send us a message and we'll let you know how to translate specific messages/sentences (basically: editing a CSV file). In any case, helping others and talking about the project around you is already a nice way to contribute !",
  "faq_local_instance": "Is is possible to launch my own Shareish server instance in my community/city ?",
  "faq_local_instance_answer": "Yes, as Shareish is fully open-source (permissive license) it can be reused for any purposes in a decentralized way. If you want to use Shareish within your community, area, city, region, or organization, you are free to install a Shareish web server following our deployment procedure (to be described after peer-review), and also to modify the code to fit your specific needs. We can also create a free redirection from e.g. https://mycommunity.shareish.org/ to your website and list it here. Please note that the Shareish original team is not liable for any content on any decentralized Shareish web server. If you are looking for collaboration or specific developments, feel free to contact us (see below last question).",
  "faq_who": "Who created this platform ?",
  "faq_who_answer": "As this project is under review at a scientific conference, we currently have to remain anonymous. The project was initiated by people who believe modern technologies can be better used to foster mutual aid strategies, and that these tools should be open-source to ease their deployment, control, reuse, and improvment. Hopefully a scientific paper will describe our approach in the near future.",
  "faq_further": "I have further comments, issues, remarks, questions, proposals, where should I send them ?",
  "faq_further_answer": "Constructive comments are very welcome and we are open to new ideas. You'll be able to report bugs using a collaborative source code repository after the scientific peer-review (see before). In the meantime, feel free to send us an e-mail here:",
