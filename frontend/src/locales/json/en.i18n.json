  "shareish_description2": "where specific items (goods and services to give or to lend for free, requests for help, free events) can be viewed, added, and edited by registered users. Items can be geolocated so it is very easy to explore your neighbourdhood hence foster local mutual aid, at your street corner or in your area. Users can start conversations to get further details about an item/request or to arrange an appointment for the exchange. These items can also be viewed as a list where they can be easily sorted according to different criteria. External public data (such as free drinking water sources, public bookcases and gift boxes, falling fruits, ...) can also be displayed. Search mechanisms and AI methods can be used to ease search and encoding",

  "faq": "Frequently asked questions (FAQ)",
  "faq_nothing": "I have nothing to give/lend, can I still use Shareish ?",
  "faq_nothing_answer": "The short answer is: YES ! The long answer is: YES, first take some time and have a look at requests, maybe you can help someone right away ! If not, please note by receiving a free good or service from others, you potentially release them from their feeling of indebtedness as they were probably previously in the same situation than you are. Also consider that you might have items/skills in the future to give/lend, it is not an issue not to have right now, Shareish is promoting mutual aid, solidarity and indirect exchange over the long term. Anyway, please have a look at your belongings/skills, you might already have things/skills to share but you are not yet aware it might be useful for others (see next question) so feel free to reference them on the Shareish platform as others might be interested in the future. Also, if you are aware of free events (give-away, repair café, ...), feel free to encode them",
  "faq_examples": "Can you give examples of items we can create and find on Shareish ?",
  "faq_examples_answer": "Items can be offers (of goods or services), requests (of goods or services), loans (of goods), or free events, so the possibilities are many. Services include, for example, helping someone to move furniture, picking up or delivering groceries, driving them to a certain place, advising them when filling out an administrative document, walking their dog, help to clean up after a flood, ... In terms of goods, we can imagine lending or donating books, kitchen utensils, surplus vegetables from the garden, household appliances, games for kids, a blanket, clothes, protective masks , ... Events can be, for example, repair workshops by volunteers (Repair café), free solidarity meals, temporary free stores, ... The possibilities for mutual aid are endless!",
  "terms_content": "1. Adding content to the platform: What can I share ?",
  "terms_content_details": "Users may offer to share any type of content provided that: - It is free of charge; - The content is not prohibited by law or contrary to public order or morality, and in particular that - it is not, notably, of a nature that is false, defamatory, insulting, misleading, offensive or obscene; - it does not infringe image rights or private life. All users must refrain from making any comments or content that is illegal, or that may cause any harm to a third party. By using Shareish, you acknowledge that no content made available by users of the platform is pre-screened, controlled or approved by the developers and managers of Shareish (hereinafter referred to as The Shareish team). The Shareish team shall have the right to refuse, remove or move any content available on a Shareish server, for a violation of the of the terms of use reported to it (via info@shareish.org), or, at its sole discretion, for any other reason. Under no circumstances shall the Shareish team be held responsible in any way whatsoever for the content present on the platform or for any loss or damage of any kind whatsoever resulting from the use of any content made available on or via a Shareish server.",
  "faq_address": "Are item adresses correct on Shareish ? If I'm interested by an item, can I go there and get it ?",
  "faq_address_answer": "The users who encode the elements themselves decide on the precision of the address they encode. Some users will reference the exact address, others a street name, district, city. In any case, it is recommended to start a conversation with a user of an item to find out the exact address and decide how to proceed with the sharing. For public elements (bookcases, give boxes, drinking water sources, etc.), the addresses are in principle verified by the OpenStreetMap and Falling Fruit communities but it is recommended to further inquire by clicking on the external link (for example some donation boxes are located in buildings that are not open 24 hours a day).",
  "faq_notifications": "How to activate/desactivate notifications when new content is available ?",
  "faq_notifications_answer": "You can set the frequency (instantly, daily, weekly, or desactivate) of e-mail notifications once new content is added to the platform in the parameters and settings of your account (see top-right menu)",
  "faq_colors": "What is the meaning of the colors of the items on the map?",
  "faq_colors_answer": "The colored markers allow you to identify elements added by Shareish users. The red position markers are requests, the green dots are offers (donation, proposals), the yellow dots are loan proposals, the purple dots are events, the blue dot indicates your detected position. In addition to these elements, you can display public data such as book and donation boxes, drinking water sources,... These public points are symbolized by icons (a book for a book box, a cabinet for a donation box, ...).",
  "faq_device": "Can I use Shareish on my computer, tablet or mobile phone? Is Shareish also available as an app?",
  "faq_device_answer": "Shareish is a website that can be viewed on these different devices. There is currently no mobile app but you can add Shareish to your homescreen on your smartphone or tablet: Use the 'add to homescreen' function in your browser.  We have not tested all combinations of equipments, browsers, operating systems, if you notice any bugs or display inconveniences, please contact us (see below)",
  "faq_data_collection": " 2. Platform privacy policy – Information and data collected: What is Shareish's privacy policy ? Which information does Shareish collect about me and for what purpose ?",
  "faq_data_collection_answer": "The data collected on the Shareish platform (https://shareish.org/) are recorded by the Institut Montefiore of the University of Liège in order to register you to the Shareish platform. Your data may be used to give you access to the platform services, to perform scientific research, and to allow students and researchers of the University to acquire and improve software development skills (in human-computer interaction, computer-supported cooperative work, and in machine learning). These data will be kept for the time of your registration to the platform. This data will be processed on the legal basis of contractual execution.  The service could not be provided without personally identifiable information that you voluntarily provide. We do require a basic level of data (an email address, a username, a password) so that you may then log in and receive notifications via email (when getting new messages or when new items are created on the platform by other users). Optionnaly, you can also provide additional information (such as other social networks profile) and your geographic location so that the Shareish web server can display items in your geographic area and sort them according to distance (but you are free to disable geolocalisation and you can decide the precision of your reference location in your profile Settings). In addition, Shareish saves the items you have viewed on the website (so that you can later only display unseen items), but this can be disabled in the Settings of your account. Shareish platform keep all functional data in a database as long as you have an active account, you can desactivate or delete your account in the Settings. These data will not be transmitted to third parties, with the exception of other users of the Shareish platform who will have access to certain data concerning you. Shareish web server does not utilize cookies (only session data are stored in your browser). Shareish uses the HTTPS protocol so that all communications between your browser and the Shareish web server are encrypted. In accordance with the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (UE 2016/679), you can exercise your rights regarding personal data (access, rectification, erasure, restriction to processing, data portability, objection) by contacting info@shareish.org or, otherwise, the ULiège Data Protection Officer (dpo@uliege.be - Mr. Data Protection Officer, Building B9 GDPR Cell, Quartier Village 3, Boulevard de Colonster 2, 4000 Liège, Belgium). You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the Data Protection Authority (https://www.dataprotectionauthority.be, contact@apd-gba.be)",
  "faq_public_resources": "I want to edit or add public resources (public bookcases, drinking water sources, falling fruits,...), how can I do it ?",
  "faq_public_resources_answer": "On Shareish you can display specific resources created by users (called individual items which are in general limited in time, such as a request for help) and other public resources (that are in general (semi-)permanent, such as drinking water sources, or public bookcases). Your specific items are stored in an internal Shareish database and directly editable on Shareish (from the map or in the Add Item menu), while public resources are retrieved from the open-access OpenStreetMap and FallingFruit databases, and indirectly editable. To add or edit public resources, we have added in our map user interface links to other website (MapComplete, OSM I-D, FallingFruit UI). To edit public resources, when you click on the map on it, we provide a link to the corresponding OpenStreetMap/MapComplete/FallingFruit node page where it is possible to edit it. To add a new public resource, right-click (or long press) on Shareish map to open a pop-up that offers links to third-party edit sites. In addition, please see below other existing editor tools that you could use to edit and add OpenStreetMap POI (points of interest) subsequently available on Shareish:",
  "faq_how_to_contribute": "How can I contribute to Shareish development ?",
  "faq_how_to_contribute_answer": "You can send us constructive comments/issues, remarks, ... (see last question). If you are a software developer, you are able to contribute to the source code (solve current issues or implement new features) available on GitHub (link in the page footer).  If you want to translate the website into your own language, it can be done by adding your translations into a publicly available CSV file on GitHub (see in frontend/src/locales/translations.csv) and trigger a pull request (or contact us). In any case, helping others and talking about the project around you is already a nice way to contribute !",
  "faq_local_instance": "Is is possible to launch my own Shareish server instance in my community/city ?",
  "faq_local_instance_answer": "Yes, as Shareish is fully open-source (permissive license, see https://github.com/shareish/shareish/blob/main/LICENSE) it can be reused for any purposes in a decentralized way. If you want to use Shareish within your community, area, city, region, or organization, you are free to install a Shareish web server following our deployment procedure available on GitHub, and also to modify the code to fit your specific needs. We can also create a free redirection from e.g. https://mycommunity.shareish.org/ to your website and list it here. Please note that the Shareish team is not liable for any content on any decentralized Shareish web server and that you must adapt the terms of use (content and confidentiality policy) of your web server in order to ensure compliance with the data protection rules for your server by yourself. If you are looking for collaboration or specific developments, feel free to contact us (see below last question).",
  "faq_who": "Who created this platform ?",
  "faq_who_answer": "The initial team is composed by researchers and students in computer science at the Montefiore Institute, University of Liège, Belgium. We are interested in human-computer interaction, computer-supported cooperative work, and machine learning. Since 2021, this platform has been designed in the context of postdoctoral research and graduation works (Master Thesis or Bachelor Internship). We share the idea modern technologies can be better used to foster mutual aid strategies and that such tools could be open-source to ease their deployment, control by user groups, reuse (replication), and improvement. A scientific paper accepted for publication in the proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Communities and Technologies (C&T 2023) describe our approach. We would be very happy if others joint and contribute to the project, if you are interested please contact us !",
  "faq_further": "I have further comments, issues, remarks, questions, proposals, where should I send them ?",
  "faq_further_answer": "Constructive comments are very welcome and we are open to new ideas as we would like the development of Shareish to be participatory. See our Contact links below to report bugs using GitHub issues or to discuss about the project using Github Discussions. Also feel free to send us an e-mail",
